# Dabr

Dabr is designed to be a **fast** and **free** way to access Twitter via *any* mobile phone.

It is specifically targeted at users with limited bandwidth, slow computers / phones, or those who just prefer a **simple** website.

This is a fork of the [original Dabr code](https://code.google.com/p/dabr/) by one of its main contributors.

## How to install

Dabr is designed to be *as simple as possible* to install on your webserver.  If you can run PHP v5.3.0 on your server, you can run Dabr.

2. Edit the file `config.sample.php` and rename it to `config.php`.
    - You'll need to [register for a Twitter API key](https://apps.twitter.com/) for your app. 
3. Upload everything onto your server - you should be good to go!
